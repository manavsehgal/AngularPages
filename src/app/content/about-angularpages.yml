  AngularPages enables you to rapidly create full-stack Angular 2 apps.
  Using Webpack for build automation, you can process YAML, JSON,
  HTML, Jade, Sass, and CSS for designing dynamic or static pages for your app.

mid: >
  The AngularPages project is available on GitHub with MIT license and
  open source. Documentation is available on this website with relevant demos.

  Best way to get started with AngularPages is to fork or clone the repo. Copy
  components that you want to use and rename, refactor these. Edit routes to
  point to your new component copies. Delete unused components. Same applies
  to content static pages and mocks.
